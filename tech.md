# BitAgentBrowser Technical Design Document

This document outlines the technical design and architecture for implementing the BitAgentBrowser project using Python. It is based on the functional description provided in `proj.md`.

## 1. Project Overview
- Briefly reiterate the goal: build an AI Agent-driven smart browsing platform.
- Highlight the core idea: using AI Agents as digital twins for automating browser tasks.

## 2. Project Architecture

The project architecture is organized in layers, aligning with the core functionalities and aiming for modularity, extensibility, robustness, and maintainability.

## 3. Module Design

A breakdown of the key modules and their responsibilities:

### 3.1. Core Modules
-   `errors.py`: Defines custom exception classes for clear error handling.
-   `agent.py`: Defines the base `Agent` class and the `Action` hierarchy. Agents encapsulate a browser page and execute sequences of actions (workflows).
-   `web_interaction.py`: Provides low-level functions for interacting with the browser page using Playwright (navigation, clicking, typing, extraction). Handles Playwright-specific details and raises `BrowserInteractionError`.
-   `orchestrator.py`: Manages the lifecycle of browser instances and agent objects. Responsible for assigning and executing workflows on agents, potentially in parallel.
-   `nlp_processor.py`: Converts natural language instructions into structured `Action` or workflow representations.
-   `main.py`: The application's entry point, handles setup, starts the orchestration process, and manages the main application loop.

### 3.2. Parsing Engine
-   `dom_parser.py`: Focuses specifically on parsing the DOM tree of a page to identify elements, their attributes, and relationships.
-   `semantic_parser.py`: Builds upon the DOM structure to create a more semantically meaningful representation of the page, identifying "digital twin nodes". May integrate VLM or other AI techniques.
-   `data_extractor.py`: Extends extraction capabilities to handle more complex data structures beyond simple tables, potentially using semantic understanding.

### 3.3. Intelligent Layer
-   `agent_logic.py`: Contains the core logic for how agents decide which actions to take based on state, parsed info, and task. Integrates AI/ML for decision-making.
-   `workflow_engine.py`: Manages complex workflow execution, including conditional logic, loops, and error recovery.

### 3.4. Security & Isolation
-   `sandbox_manager.py`: Handles creating and managing isolated environments for agents (e.g., Docker, Playwright contexts).
-   `credential_manager.py`: Securely stores and provides access to sensitive information.
-   `auditing_logger.py`: Implements a logging and auditing system for tracking agent actions.

### 3.5. Anti-Crawler Module
-   `anti_crawler_strategies.py`: Implements techniques like user agent/header management, delays, proxies, CAPTCHA handling.

### 3.6. Data & Reporting
-   `data_processor.py`: Contains functions for cleaning, transforming, and structuring extracted data.
-   `analysis_engine.py`: Provides capabilities for analyzing processed data.
-   `reporter.py`: Handles generating reports and visualizations.

### 3.7. Cross-Platform Interaction
-   `os_interactor.py`: Provides a safe interface for agents to interact with the local operating system (files, input simulation).
-   `communication_manager.py`: Handles communication with external systems or devices (e.g., WebSocket).

### 3.8. User Interface / API
-   `cli_interface.py` / `web_interface.py` / `api_layer.py`: Handle receiving input, displaying feedback, and presenting results.

## 4. Step-by-Step Implementation Plan (High-Level)
- Break down the development process into phases (e.g., core browser control, basic parsing, agent execution, NLP integration, advanced features).

## 5. Open Questions / Future Work
- Areas that require further research or definition.
- Potential challenges and how to address them.
